# My_Bioinformatics_Journey

Welcome, my name is Samuel, and I'm an aspiring bioinformatician.

Most of my education and knowledge when it comes to programming and bioinformatics comes from TED-X and Coursera courses such as the John Hopkins University Genomics Data Science specialization and the Georgia EdX Computing in Python series of courses.

This is an archive for all the algorithms, code chunks, and projects both completed and under work that I have done/will do as part of my bioinformatics learning and growth journey.

Disclaimer : some of the scripts in the repository have not been created by me, but are rather scripts provided in some of the courses, which I may have modified/adjusted, or left as is. This is specifically true for most of the scripts in the GenomicDataScienceSpecialization folder.
